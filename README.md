### Object Store
This is the main controling class that has the settings. It handles transactions.
There are many derived classes for different storage types.


### Repository
This is a repository of objects. 
The main functions (Get/remove/etc.) are called from here
Each has got it's own metadata which carries a object version, save and update times etc.
On creation it is passed a store instance which is ueses.

### Repository Object
This reprsents an object returned by the repository. This has a save function to update just this record.
It has an "objectStoreTypeString" parameter which segments the data.

### Double String Index
This is equivalent to a repository but much simpler.
There is no object type.
It is just a set of strings which can be quicklky looked up. There are no extra metadata stored.
objectStoreTypeString which segments the data.
